# Firebase Authentication Template

This repository is home to a simple template for adding Firebase Authentication to your own projects. It is a fullstack app built with Vue, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and TypeScript. On top of the essential authentication code, this app also includes support for frontend navigation guards, restricted API routes, and administrator privilege restrictions. The frontend app allows for simple API and navigation tests to be run to understand how the Firebase Authentication system works in this project. Much of the code here will not be used in your app and is only for demonstration purposes. However, the basic structure needed for Firebase Authentication has been implemented and can be used as needed. More information on usage can be found on the [live demonstration site.](https://auth.harrisonbludworth.com)

## Implementing the Template

As mentioned above, much of the code available in the project can be referenced, copied, or otherwise used to create your own implementation of a Firebase Authentication system in your own project. Below I will outline how to run the project locally, but will not give details on what adjustments you may need to make for your own project. The guide below operates under the assumption that you already know how to create a MongoDB database and have already created a Firebase project.
